As cAdvisor UI is currently using jQuery < 3.5.0 this is an active vulnerability. Upgrading JQuery to 3.5.0 should fix this vulnerability.  According to the self-reported version in the script, the version of JQuery hosted on the remote web server is greater than or equal to 1.2 and prior to 3.5.0. It is, therefore, affected by a cross site scripting vulnerability.  More info about the vulnerability: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/136929  "

I found instances where certain keywords such as TODO, HACK, FIXME, bug repository IDs, in comments within Chef scripts. According to the Common Weakness Enumeration organization this is a security weakness (CWE-546: Suspicious Comment https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/546.html).  I am trying to find out if you agree with the findings. I think it is possible to have a nuanced perspective. Any feedback is appreciated.
